## System_Information.bat
*System_Information.bat* collects information about the system.

The information collected is related to the Hardware, OS and installed software.
It can be ran either from command line or by double-clicking on it. When running the script, it will create a new folder *System Information* relative to the location where the script is launched, and the information collected will be dumped into this new folder in the file *System_Information.txt*.
